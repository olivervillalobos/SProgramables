3. Calculate, measure and record the requested values ​​for Vout1, under the 3 conditions required in the attached table.

| Number | Condition | Meassured Vout1 voltage | Meassured R1 voltage | Indicated temperature |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1      | Minimum    |  0.0999V           |          0.011V  |         -40°C         |
| 2      | Medium    |       0.919V            |         0.011V    |        42°C            |
| 3      | Maximum    |       1.75V         |      0.011V       |          125°C      |

**Temperature formula=** (Vout - 0.5) * 100

**Minimum=** (0.0999 - 0.5) * 100 = **-40.01**

**Medium=** (0.919 - 0.5) * 100 = **41.9**

**Maximum=** (1.75 - 0.5) * 100 = **125**

## Minimum

4. Using the image of the TMP36 transistor corresponding to stage 1, connect the Vout1 terminal to the non-inverting terminal of the LM741, and assemble the circuit corresponding to stage 2.

5. **What value should R3 have in the Stage 2 circuit, in order to obtain Vout2 = 3.3 volts,** for the maximum temperature condition that the sensor is capable of detecting? As can be seen, the resistance R3 corresponds to a potentiometer, however, resistance arrangements can be made to achieve a fine adjustment. What do you think is the reason for requesting a **3.3 Volt setting**?

```
Since we already have two resistors, both with the same value (220 ohm) and a 10k potentiometer, we found easier to add a third resistor of the same value (220 ohm) giving the final value of 3.46V, which is the closest to the 3.3V vout requested on the instruction. We could've used either the 220 ohm resistor or the 180 ohm one, which we didn't use because the finalt voltage turn out to be 3.16V. 
We add a third resistor because this augment the precision of every result without affecting the device sensitivity.
```
   
6. Once the R3 value has been adjusted, leave it like that and record the requested values ​​for Vout2, for the 3 required conditions in the attached table.

| Number | Condition        | Meassured R2 Voltage | Meassured Vout2 Voltage | Indicated temperature |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1      | Minimum condition |           0.0999V           |          0.198V               |        -40°C              |
| 2      | Medium condition  |        0.929V          |              1.84V       |            43°C         |
| 3      | Maximum condition |          1.75V         |          3.46           |             125°C     |

**Temperature formula=** (Vout - 0.5) * 100

**Minimum=** (0.198 - 0.5) * 100 = **-30.2**

**Medium=** (1.94 - 0.5) * 100 = **144**

**Maximum=** (3.46 - 0.5) * 100 = **296**

## Conclusions:

:sunglasses: **Oliver**: The TMP36 sensor provides a voltage output that is linearly proportional to the celsius temperature meassured. It is very sensitive and has a wide variety of applications.

:alien: **Ariel**: Ariel: The changes on the voltage output is linearly proportional with the temperature (celsius) simulated on the TMP36 sensor.

:dog: **Edgardo**: The TMP 36 sensor allows us to measure temperature more precisely which makes it perfect for Environmental Control Systems,Thermal Protection,Industrial Process Control, Fire alarms,Power System Monitors, Processor Thermal Management.

:heart_eyes_cat: **Javier**: The TMP36 sensor is a very interesting sensor in its way of acting because it takes heat as a form of resistance to protect objects that require a specific temperature or it is required to be in a limit of temperature ranges to continue performing a function in the device that is installed.

:see_no_evil: **Mauricio**: In this activity we were able to see the function of detecting a temperature signal and sending a voltage in response, as the voltage signal is very small, the LM741 amplifier is used so that the voltage increases and the change in voltage can be appreciated. It should be noted that the activity asks to calculate based on 3.3 volts but due to the use of commercial values, the closest we got was 3.46 volts.
