**3. As can be seen in the previous circuit, there is an area identified as "Time Network" and another "Decoupling filter", explain the purpose of both terminologies**.

**Time network:** it refers to the area where the timing of the timer is controlled, here you'll find the components that control the time.

**Decoupling filter:** it is the area where the capacitor is located, where the signal is cleaned. Here the AC signals are decoupled from a DC signal. It also moderates voltage fluctuation noise.

**4. Continuing with the previous image, observe the equation Ct = 1.1 * R1 * C1 is shown, **which is used to set the output pulse on time**. Based on that equation above calculate the values ​​of **R1 and C1** if you want to keep the output pulse on, given the 3 conditions required in the attached table.**

**Number** | **Condition** | **Value for R1** | **Value for C1**
---------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------
1 | 3 seconds| 27kohm | 0.0001uF
2 | 5 seconds| 47kohm | 0.0001uF
3 | 8 seconds| 68kohm | 0.0001uF

**3 SEGUNDOS: Condensador de 0.0001uF**
```
R1= 3s / (1.1 * 0.0001F)
R1=27272.7273 ohms
Ct = 1.1 * 0.0001uF * 27272.7273ohm
Ct=3s
Resistencia 27kohm:
Ct = 1.1 * 0.0001uF * 27kohm
Ct=2.97s
```

**5 SEGUNDOS: Condensador de 0.0001uF**
```
R1= 5s / (1.1 * 0.0001F)
R1=45454.5455 ohms
Ct = 1.1 * 0.0001uF * 45454.5455ohm
Ct=5s
Resistencia 47kohm:
Ct = 1.1 * 0.0001uF * 47kohm
Ct=5.17s
```

**8 SEGUNDOS: Condensador de 0.0001uF**
```
R1= 8s / (1.1 * 0.0001F)
R1=72727.2727ohms
Ct = 1.1 * 0.0001uF *72727.2727ohms
Ct=8s
Resistencia 68kohm:
Ct = 1.1 * 0.0001uF * 68kohm
Ct=7.48s
```

**5. Once the above table is completed, start the simulation for any of the three conditions and observe the behavior of the Led; explain your observation.**

<p align="center">

Basically, the led remains on for 3 seconds, then it turns off. 
That being said, if the microswitch is pressed down, same process will occur as before.
Now, the led will be on as long as we hold down the microswitch until we release it. 

**6. Assemble stage 2 and integrate the terminal of the output pulse to the input of the base of the transistor of this second stage.**

</p>

**7. After completing the previous step, choose one of the 3 conditions recorded in the table above and observe the behavior of the DC motor; explain your observation.**

<p align="center">

A 3 second time grid was used to make this observation. There can be seen that as long as the button is not pressed, the voltage recorded on the LM555 is 9 volts, once the button is pressed, the voltage recorded is 250mv, this is because now the power current runs through the output going to the transistor and the led. The led and the motor remain active for 3 seconds, then they are turned off and the multimeter returns to mark the 9 volts, since the voltage stops running through the motor and returns to be stored in the battery.

**8. Once the stage 1 output pulse on time is complete, what happens to the DC motor? Explain the reason for this behavior?**

When the power-on time expires, the DC motor and any component connected to the voltage output of the LM555 stops receiving voltage, because the voltage pulse sent by the LM555 is terminated and the button disconnects the trigger from ground again.

**9. Include the individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.**

## Conclusions.
:sunglasses: **Oliver**:  The 555 integrated circuit has plenty of applications, given its configuration it can be very useful as a timer. You can fit a DC motor in a circuit alongside a 555 circuit and with the correct electronic componentes you can manage to turn on and off a motor within a given time. It is helpfull to know the formula to calculate a signal duration with a 555 circuit because that way, you can make proper arrangements on the values of the tranistors and capacitors used in the time grid section.

:alien: **Ariel**: This was a different circuit than the ones I have worked on before, since this time it was not only one component that made a difference in the circuit, but other concepts were included, such as the timing network and the decoupling capacitor, as well as how they affect the behavior of the DC motor. 

:dog: **Edgardo**: The 555 timer is an apparatus capable of regulating the connection or disconnection of an electrical circuit after a time has been programmed. In other words, it allows us to program the on and off of different devices in a simple way.

:heart_eyes_cat: **Javier**: The 555 timer is a more complicated device to use because it requires you to interact with it to begin to perform its function of managing energy during intervals, but the 555 can be automated to perform its function when it receives stimulation from other sensors so that perform cyclic functions with intervals between action and action


:see_no_evil: **Mauricio**: I found the practice quite interesting, in particular the section of stage 2. The first thing was that in real life the motor has to have a recoil when it stops having current, I also liked the use of the timer to be able to learn how it works. and how to calculate the theoretical values.

**10.Evidence, such as meetings or teamwork on any online platform.**
