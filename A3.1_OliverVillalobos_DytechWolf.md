**3. Carry out the program that allows, through one of the Arduino's inputs, to receive the value that registers the Ultrasonic Sensor when approaching an object at different distances.**
```
const int trigPin = 11;
const int echoPin = 12;
float time, distance;
void setup() 
{
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);  
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);  
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop() 
{
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);  
  delayMicroseconds(2);  
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);  
  delayMicroseconds(10);  
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);  
  
  time = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  
  distance = (time*.0343)/2;  
  
  // For Serial Monitor
  Serial.print("Distance:CM ");  
  Serial.println(distance);  
}
```

**4. Considering that the ultrasonic sensor has a minimum and maximum detection range based on the return time of the sonic signal, which values are obtained in the simulation under the following terms:**

Number | Condition 1 | Condition 2 | The object was detected? 
------ | ----------- | ----------- | -----------------------
1 | 5 cm apart from the sensor | 0 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor | Yes
2 | 50 cm apart from the sensor | 35 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor  | Yes
3 | 100 cm apart from the sensor | -35 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor | Yes
4 | 5 cm apart from the sensor | 90 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor | No
5 | 50 cm apart from the sensor | -60 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor | yes
6 | 350 cm apart from the sensor | 0 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor | No

**6.Having completed the integration of the I2C Display, set the program that allows you through the display will show the following message, "Target detected at? cm, and if detection is not achieved indicate the message "Target out of range"**

```
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>
LiquidCrystal lcd = LiquidCrystal(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7); // Create an LCD object. Parameters: (RS, E, D4, D5, D6, D7):
const int trigPin = 11;
const int echoPin = 12;
float time, distance;
void setup() 
{
    lcd.begin(16, 2); // Specify the LCD's number of columns and rows. Change to (20, 4) for a 20x4 LCD
    pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);  
	pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);  
	Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() 
{
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);  
  delayMicroseconds(2);  
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);  
  delayMicroseconds(10);  
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);

  distance = (time*.0343)/2;  

  Serial.println("Range in cm:");
  Serial.print(distance);
    lcd.clear();
  if(distance > 333 || distance < 2.5)
  {
    lcd.setCursor(0,0);
    lcd.print("Not detected.");
  }
  else
  {
    lcd.setCursor(0,0);
    lcd.print("Range in cm:");
    lcd.setCursor(0,1);
    lcd.print(distance);
    }
  delay(500);

**7. Include the individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.**

## Conclusions.
:sunglasses: **Oliver**: Making the detection sensor circuit without the LCD screen wasn't hard, it was quite interesting and exciting though. If I had to say something that could've been a challenge, I would say using a different sensor model as the one shown in the assignment.  Things started to get complicated as we move forward in the practice,  first, it started with the LCD, since Tinkercad doesn't include in its library an easy adapter to Arduino, we had to struggle figuring out how to connect a bunch of pins into it. Then, we had to figure out how to connect de potentiometer. That being said, the practice was really fun to make, i learned a lot, and it was my first experience with a external library (Liquidcrystal).

:alien: **Ariel**: This was a very productive practice, because I have little knowledge in the Arduino area. Connecting the ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 was not a big problem, neither was finding the code for its use, however, finding the way to use the LCD monitor was quite complicated, even now, I am not very clear how to make it work, I had to follow a lot the tutorial I used.

:dog: **Edgardo**: Implementing the sainsmart HC-SR04 combining with the arduino allows us to create a circuit capable of detecting objects at different distances in addition to saying how far it is with relation to the sensor

:heart_eyes_cat: **Javier**: The implementation of the I2C LCD Display is not an easy task because it is not only to connect it to the electrical current but also to send it the information and programming on what it must show apart from the fact that now these components require delicacy when programming due because if it is given an incorrect supply it could burn out or at the time of programming it not send the correct information to display. For now, my understanding of the system is quite limited as more devices start to connect to perform a task.

:see_no_evil: **Mauricio**: Something that I found quite interesting when developing the practice was the operation of the ultrasonic sensor in the simulation. In the code carried out, a delay of 2 and 10 microseconds was used due to the technical specifications of the sensor, but it was found that it does not need exactly those values ​​to be able to carry out the simulation in Tinkercad. This shows that, although the simulation is very successful in many parts, it does not compare to doing the practice with physical components.Another detail is that when making the circuit the led and monitor in series did not display the data, that was because I used pin 1, and searching the internet I saw that it is not recommended to use pin 0 and 1 on an LCD because these pins are for serial communication.

**8.Evidence, such as meetings or teamwork on any online platform.**
