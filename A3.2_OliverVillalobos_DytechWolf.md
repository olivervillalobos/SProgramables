**2. Once the previous circuit has been assembled, carry out a program that allows the assembly to meet the following conditions:**
    
* The system must be able to turn ** an LED ** on and off by pressing the touch sensor.
* The system will have the characteristic that if the Led is on, when touching the touch sensor, it will initiate a 3-second intermittent sequence (that is, it turns off for 1 second, it turns on for one second and finally turns off).
* The system must have the characteristic that if the Led is off, when touching the touch sensor, it will turn on little by little until it reaches its maximum illumination level.

### Code.
```
// set pin numbers
const int touchPin = 4; 
const int ledPin = 23;
// change with your threshold value
const int threshold = 23;
// variable for storing the touch pin value 
int touchValue;
// setting PWM properties
const int freq = 5000;
const int ledChannel = 0;
const int resolution = 8;

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(115200);
  // configure LED PWM functionalitites
  ledcSetup(ledChannel, freq, resolution);
  // attach the channel to the GPIO to be controlled
  ledcAttachPin(ledPin, ledChannel);
}

void loop(){
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  touchValue = touchRead(touchPin);
  Serial.println(touchValue);
  // check if the touchValue is below the threshold
  // if it is, set ledPin to HIGH
  if(touchValue < threshold)//esto es para ver si estas tocando o no en base al limite(threshold)
  {
    if(digitalRead(ledPin))
    {
      ledcWrite(ledChannel, 0);
      delay(1000);
      ledcWrite(ledChannel,255);
      delay(1000);
      ledcWrite(ledChannel, 0);
      delay(1000);
    }
    else
    {
      for(int dutyCycle = 0; dutyCycle <= 255; dutyCycle++)
      {   
        // changing the LED brightness with PWM
        ledcWrite(ledChannel, dutyCycle);
        delay(7); 
      }
    } 
  }
  delay(1000);
}
```

**4. Include the individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.**

## Conclusions.
:sunglasses: **Oliver**: The ESP32 is a perfect microcontroller for a small breadboard, as well for programming your circuit when a Arduino Uno is not an option.
We had issues installing COM 4 port, but we managed to achieve the installation. As for the assembly of the circuit, it was easy, zero complaints. The coding part was tricky, especially the modulating led light.

:alien: **Ariel**: The ESP32 works very similar to Arduino, there was no big problem due to the fact that it has many inputs to use. For the code, thanks to several tutorials, it wasn't complicated either, the only problem we had was the modulation of the LED light, but in the end it worked out fine.

:dog: **Edgardo**: When developing the practice with the ESP32, it became a little more complicated than anything with the second part of the practice because the first was very similar to the previous practice, but above all, learning one of the many applications that the ESP32 has

:heart_eyes_cat: **Javier**: The ESP32 is a more complex device to use because it has more inputs for use and each one is designed for a more or less function than others. Another thing that becomes complicated than to make Led perform more actions such as slow start-up that takes up more instructions than sudden start-up.

:see_no_evil: **Mauricio**: In this practice, the ESP32 was used, which for me was the first time working with it, so this practice was not made a bit complicated, the first part we already had for past examples but the second part was the most complicated, especially the to make the led turn off and on. to finish I learned the functions that the ESP32 has and what the pins do.

**5.Evidence, such as meetings or teamwork on any online platform.**
