### :pencil2: Development
___ 

1. Use the following list of materials to prepare the activity and add your *bibliographic* *link* in the column "Source of consultation".

Quantity | Description | Source of consultation
-------- | ----------- | ------------------
1 | Fotoresistor sensor LDR of 2M | [Light Sensitive Resistor (LDR)](https://www.pcboard.ca/ldr-light-dependent-resistor)
1 | 1k Resistor | [Resistor 1K](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/through-hole-fixed-resistors/7077666/)
1 | 5V Power Supply | [5V Power Supplies](https://www.acopian.com/5v-power-supplies.html)

2. Considering that the LDR element is a photoresistive sensor, that is, its resistance varies based on the amount of light that falls on it, **What do you see in the following graph?**

</p>

### What can be interpreted is that if the value of Lux is high, the resistance measured in ohms decreases, so it is notable that with a lower or zero value of Lux, the value in ohms increases.

3. Assemble the circuit shown using the simulator you are considering, placing the photoresistor in the LDR position and resistor according to the schematic image:

</p>

4. Place the finally obtained image of the assembled circuit inside your simulator.

</p>

5. Measure the resistance of the photoresistor with an ohmmeter under the following conditions: absence of light or dark, ambient light, intensive light.

6. Calculate the theoretical voltage-out value for each of the conditions.

7. Get the measured vout value for each of the conditions.

8. Calculate the voltage accuracy value between the theoretical and the measured for each condition, consider including an explanation in this section regarding how we calculated the theoretical values.

9. Measure the resistance of the photoresistor with the ohmmeter under the following conditions: absence of light or dark, ambient light, intensive light and record in the corresponding table.

10. Calculate the theoretical Vout value for each of the conditions indicated above as well as the measured Vout value and record it in the corresponding table.

11. Calculate the voltage accuracy value between theoretical and measured value for each condition and record it in the corresponding table.

Number | Condition | Impedance in photoresistance | Theoretical vout voltage | Measured vout voltage | % V.Measured/V.Theoretical  
------ | --------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------| -----------------------
1|Light Absence| 180,000 ohms | 0.03v | 0.0277v | 92%  
2|Enviromental Light| 912 ohms | 2.62v | 2.61v | 100%
3|Intense Light| 506 ohms | 3.32v | 3.32v | 100%  

- **Light Absence = (1000omh * 5v) / (180000omh + 1000ohm) = 5000omhv / 181000omh = 0.0277v**
- **Enviromental Light = (1000omh * 5v) / (900omh + 1000ohm) = 5000omhv / 1900omh = 2.61v**
- **Intense Light = (1000omh * 5v) / (506omh + 1000ohm) = 5000omhv / 1900omh = 3.32v**

12. Make a graph using the values ​​recorded in the table above, where the "X" axis is the Measured vout voltage and the "Y" axis represent the impedance of the photoresistor LDR, and insert the graph.

14. Include the individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.

## Conclusions.
:sunglasses: **Oliver**: Despite the interpretation of the graphic at excercise number two, we can say now for sure that, the greatest the amount of lux, the less resistance the LDR has.
That said, you get more voltage out of the circuit in high intensity ilumminated situations.

:alien: **Ariel**: We could observe how the phototransistor changes its resistance depending on the amount of lux (light) it is exposed to, this being higher the increasing resistance from light absence and ambiental light.

:dog: **Edgardo**: If the value of lux is at a high level, the resistance measured in ohms decreases, so we can say that between a lower or null value of Lux the ohms value of the resistance increases.

:heart_eyes_cat: **Javier**: We can affirm that the theory of the operation of the photo resistor is true because in the observations made in the circuit when we darken the photosensor so that it measures less lux, its resistance increases, being totally opposite to when we expose it to its low impedance.

:see_no_evil: **Mauricio**: In the simulation we could see how in the photoresistance the lower the light, the greater the resistance and vice versa the higher the light, the lower the resistance, it also depends a lot on what values are given to the photoresistance in the simulator since it varies when comparing them with the calculated values and they may not always be exact.
