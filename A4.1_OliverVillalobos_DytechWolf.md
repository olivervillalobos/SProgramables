**2. Based on the images shown in **Figures 1**, assemble the circuit with the end of obteining a system capable of accomplish the following instructions**

* Through the application "Serial Bluetooth terminal" that can be downloaded from the play Store of google or even any other that considers, must control the starting and stopping of the DC motor that is, there will be two requests, one of which represents the "START" and the other option "STOP" 
* The motor must be able to rotate clockwise for 5 seconds, upon completion of that
time must stop 1 second and reverse its turn for another 5 seconds.

**6. Include the individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.**

## Conclusions.

:sunglasses: **Oliver**: The practice was very interesting, figuring out how the h-bridge connected was a challenge because of my tiny breadboard. However, with some adjustments I managed to solve them. Making the connection with the cell phone via bluetooth did not present problems.
The interruption of the motor rotation was a real problem, the while loop was not an immediate solution, as it waited for the 11 seconds of the motor instruction to pass, so I opted to take small steps using the if instruction.

:alien: **Ariel**: Assembling this circuit was not difficult at all, however, the code to make the motor stops in the middle of the instruction was quite troublesome at a begining, we had to investigate trough, tryed some codes and found one that we understand the most to use. The usage of the application and the code used for the bluethooth feature were easy too to implement in the circuit.

:dog: **Edgardo**: This practice was more complicated than what I expected because I was handling some concepts, I did not understand them very well but what you can understand quite clearly is that with the l293D sensor we are able to control several motors at the same time as well as to be able to define instructions with the help from the esp32 we can use the bluetooth to link it with the phone and from there send the instructions that we want to carry out.

:heart_eyes_cat: **Javier**: As we were able to verify that we can use the ESP32 as an interface to be able to interact remotely so that it is possible with the system without having to expose the ESP32 to environmental hazards, it is also useful in automation because through personalized connections a fluid system without the need to stop the line of work.

:see_no_evil: **Mauricio**: In this practice we used the ESP32 again with the implementation of a DC Motor, this particular practice was the most complicated that has not been presented since we had a lot of problems with the coding and especially with the connection with the bluetooth. In our case we developed a code but at the time of connecting it with the bluetooth it did not turn on the engine due to a code error. After investigating on our part, we did not solve it at the time since we still did not know why the code error was occurring. We took a little longer than normal to finish this practice but in the end we managed to resolve the errors we had.
