**3. Once the circuit above is assembled, add an RGB LED and create the program that allows the RGB LED to function as an indicator for the following conditions:**

* The temperature sensor will be sensing at all times, sending the value registered by the serial terminal, for example "Ambient temperature: 25 degrees" and the **RGB LED** will be lit green.
* When the temperature sensor registers a value of ~ 20% above the ambient temperature, it should display the message "High temperature:? Degrees" and the **RGB LED** will turn red.
* When the temperature sensor registers a value of ~ 20% below the ambient temperature, it should display the message "Low temperature:? Degrees" and the **RGB LED** will turn blue.

### Code:
```

#define DHTPIN 4     // Digital pin connected to the DHT sensor
#define DHTTYPE DHT11   // DHT 11
//#define DHTTYPE DHT22   // DHT 22  (AM2302), AM2321
//#define DHTTYPE DHT21   // DHT 21 (AM2301)
DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

const int REDchannel = 0;

const int GREENled= 16;
const int GREENchannel= 1;

const int BLUEled= 17;

  ledcAttachPin(REDled, REDchannel);
  ledcAttachPin(GREENled, GREENchannel);
  ledcAttachPin(BLUEled, BLUEchannel);
}

void loop() {
  // Wait a few seconds between measurements.
  delay(500);
  // Reading temperature takes about 250 milliseconds!
  // Sensor readings may also be up to 2 seconds 'old' (its a very slow sensor)
  // Read temperature as Celsius (the default)
  float celsius = dht.readTemperature();
  if(celsius>=24 && celsius<25)
  {
    ledcWrite(REDchannel,  255);
    ledcWrite(GREENchannel, 0);
    ledcWrite(BLUEchannel,  255);
    Serial.print(F("Temperatura ambiente: "));
  }
  else if(celsius>25)
  {
    ledcWrite(REDchannel,  0);
    ledcWrite(GREENchannel, 255);
    ledcWrite(BLUEchannel,  255);
    Serial.print(F("Temperatura alta: "));

    ledcWrite(GREENchannel, 255);
    ledcWrite(BLUEchannel,  0);
    Serial.print(F("Temperatura baja: "));
  }

**5. Include the individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.**

## Conclusions.

:sunglasses: **Oliver**: The practice was a headache. The connection with the temperature sensor was simple, it was just a matter of installing a couple of libraries and using reserved words. Turning on the led caused many problems, it was even thought that it was defective, however, the error was not knowing how the breadboard works. By solving this aspect, the practice could be concluded as soon as possible without any inconvenience.

:alien: **Ariel**: Now that we have experience with the ESP32, this practice was not complicated in regards to the circuit, however, the coding I can't say it was the same. The use of the DHT11 and the RGB LED complicated things a bit. The DHT11 due to the use of the library in the code, which did not complicate things as such, it was very easy to understand, but the fact that the RGB LED we have has a flaw, that made things more complicated.

:dog: **Edgardo**: The DHT11 is a low cost digital humidity and temperature sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and displays the data by a digital signal on the data pin (there are no analog input pins). It is quite simple to use, but requires careful timing to collect data. so it is easy to use but you just have to take into account its synchronization so that it works as it should

:heart_eyes_cat: **Javier**: The use of the DHT sensor together with the ESP to make a device that warns about the change in temperature seems quite easy but it is complicated due to the channels that we use for the LED that will be "independent" even if we use the same LED light so the connection it can get complicated.

:see_no_evil: **Mauricio**: What I found interesting was that there are two types of rgb led, one with a common cathode and one with a common anode, before doing the activity we had to check our type of led so that it would work according to the scheme of each led.
I was quite surprised by the temperatures at which the DHT sensor can work, as one would think that it would stop working when exposed to too high or low temperatures.

**6.Evidence, such as meetings or teamwork on any online platform.**
