**2. Based on the images shown in **Figures 1**, assemble the circuit and add a led to one of the terminals of the device in a way that a system capable of accomplish the following instructions can be obtained**

* NodeMCU should be used as a standalone Web server, which should provide a visual interface, which will show an image representing "ON and OFF" behavior depending on the ambient lighting condition.
* The lighting sensor should be measuring the amount of light that exists in the environment.
* At the moment of detecting the LDR sensor, absence of light should show in the Web interface a "ON" state, otherwise the "OFF" state must be displayed
* To the circuit of figure 1, a relay in series with a light bulb should be added, which will be activated in the opposite condition to the state "ON" and "OFF", that is, once the sensor detects little or no lighting will activate the relay and therefore will turn on the bulb, and otherwise it will turn off.

**6. Include the individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.**

## Conclusions.

:sunglasses: **Oliver**: This has been the hardest circuit yet, regardless of the extra time we got to finish the assignment, we almost didnt finish. Since im the one that have the ESP32 NODE MCU, I struggle a lot building up the circuit. As for the code, we manage to turn on the relay on and off quite easy, nevertheless, making the led light turn on at light abscence,  was overly hard. 
When we  thought that was it, the web server HTML code wasnt working at all, so we had to rebuild pretty much all the code in order to make it work.

:alien: **Ariel**: In this practice we utilized the wifi module of the ESP 32 along with an LDR to show in a standalone server a signal. It were hard to do, we had to investigate various topics to get the idea. Even tho the teacher gave us a website that had a very similar circuit, it had considerable changes. Using the library to get the server working was the most difficult part of this activity.

:dog: **Edgardo**: In this practice we saw that ESP32 can be combined with html to be able to create more complex practices, in this case we combine it with html to be able to use another of the capabilities that ESP32 has, which is to use wi-fi to communicate with an html server or a web page, in this case we communicate the Esp32 with an ldr sensor that is responsible for sending a signal that allows the led to turn on and show an image where it mentions that the led is on and is updated every so often.

:heart_eyes_cat: **Javier**: We were able to understand how using different components and materials to be able to create an application that warns when the exterior lights turn on because it detects the lack of light. This is due to the interaction of the LDR sensor as a way to detect the light when it is necessary to turn it on and the web page as a way to check that the lights have been turned on and could also warn about presence if another sensor was attached to the system.

:see_no_evil: **Mauricio**: This practice was somewhat difficult to carry out because we did not know what was necessary to have a stable base in which to work, after carrying out the appropriate programming and correctly configuring the representation so that it would be shown on, the connection could be made so that It will display a notification that will show that it had been turned on, but in this practice the most complex part was programming since there is not so much information that shows the correct way in which things can be done.
