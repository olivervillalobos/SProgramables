## Introduction
This document will present information about the optical distance sensor SHARP GP2Y0A02YK0F, covering various physical and electrical characteristics, some possible applications and explaining the stimulus which it responds to.

___

## Development

**Meaning**
GP2Y0A02YK0F is a distance measuring sensor unit, composed of an integrated combination of PSD (position sensitive detector) , IRED (infrared emitting diode) and signal processing circuit. The variety of the reflectivity of the object, the environmental temperature and the operating duration are not influenced easily by distance detection because of adopting the triangulation method. This device outputs the voltage corresponding to the detection distance. So this sensor can also be used as a proximity sensor.

**Physical** **characteristics**
- Measuring distance: 20cm to 150cm
- Connection: 3-pin JST PH connector (cable with connector included)
- Weight:	0.005 kg
- Dimensions:	4.5 × 2.3 × 1.9 cm

</p>

**Explain how it behaves with the *environment* or what stimulus it responds to.**
The sensor is not very sensitive to the color and reflectivity of the detected object, or to the ambient temperature. However, it can be affected by ambient light if it receives a high degree of brightness directly, especially when used outdoors. They can also provide incorrect measurements when detecting transparent or very bright objects, especially glass and mirrors.

**Application uses.**
1. Touch-less switch
 (Sanitary equipment, Control of illumination, etc. )

2. Sensor for energy saving
 (ATM, Copier, Vending machine, Laptop computer,
 LCD monitor)

3. Amusement equipment
 (Robot, Arcade game machine)

We can use the GP2Y0A02YK0F in our robots to measure distances in medium and long ranges in a narrow beam. Given their different characteristics, we can combine them with HC-SR04 type ultrasound sensors for short or wide ranges, or obstacle detection sensors for very short distances.

In short term, the Sharp sensor can also be used in other types of applications such as, for example, Touch-Less systems, lighting control, position sensors, limit switches or object detection in a certain area.

**Conclusions**

:sunglasses: **Oliver**: The sharp sensor GP2Y0A02YK0F in short terms is a well build sensor which the variety of the reflectivity of the object, the environmental temperature and the operating duration are not influenced easily to the distance detection because of adopting the triangulation method. This is a important feature because, distance measuring can be crucial in some occasions.

:alien: **Ariel**: The GP2Y0A02YK0F is very practical for almost any physical objects related circuits, this model in particular is better measuring mid to large than other commercial optic sensor, its small and does not add almost any weight to the dispositive/circuit. 

:dog: **Edgardo**: The sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F sensor is very useful to detect objects, using a triangulation method, so the weather conditions do not affect it.

:heart_eyes_cat: **Javier**: The GP2Y0A02YK0F sensor is an incredibly easy to use device and quite useful for being a "commercial" sensor, it may not be used for heavy or specialized industrial use but it does its job, its only flaws are that it occupies a JST connector to connect to the circuit.

:see_no_evil: **Mauricio**: The sharp sensor is the best option when you want to measure medium and long-range distances, since in short distances it has difficulties to give a good measurement.
